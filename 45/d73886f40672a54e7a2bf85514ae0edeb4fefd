@loic425 I forgot to remove 4.4 from the build workflow . I guess that's why these builds were failing.

This will be the first part then. The branch name used for this PR doesn't make much sense now, but let's say it doesn't matter. :smiley:

One thing I'm still not sure of is whether to keep `dev-master` branch alias at `1.11-dev` or `1.12-dev`.
