Hello @pamil

You have removed Travis but it's required to make PR green.
Can you remove it from checklist?

Regards

Generally üëç but I think we should also bump a PayPalPlugin minimal version to `^1.1`... with the current `^1.0.3`  there is still a possibility to install the version that does not support DoctrineMigrations 3.0. WDYT?

Indeed :/ we should think about switching to something more reliable for JS tests.
